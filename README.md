# FaceOSCtoTouchDesigner
This is a basic Touch Designer patch receiving messages from Kyle McDonald's FaceOSC. This patch is my first time using TouchDesigner099 or FaceOSC for that matter. It barely scratches the surface of what both programs can do. There's lots of sample code for FaceOSC's interface with creative programming languages (Max, PD, Processing) but none for Touch Designer so hopefully this saves someone some time. 

#Basics
The FaceOSC standalone app is used to send raw data to Touch Designer via OSC messages. Messages are then scaled, parsed, and instanced to represent key facial features.
